AutoMI is a chain of multi-brand auto body shops that intends to offer its customers a new online service for managing post-sales activities (e.g., inspections, servicing). This service allows AutoMI to send notifications to inform the customer about the need to perform periodic inspections required by law, and also allows the customer to book an appointment for servicing when a certain mileage is reached.

To provide this service, AutoMI will adopt a new software module that will interact via API, both in read and write mode, with AutoMI’s internal CRM, and in read-only mode with the so-called "Portale dell'Automobilista" (Driver’s Portal) made available via cloud by the Ministry of Transportation. It should be noted that the information obtained from the Portale dell'Automobilista is used only for notifications.

From a technological standpoint, the new system will be a three-tiered system deployed on virtual machines running on external cloud providers.

With reference to the previous text, define the Archimate diagram consisting of the Business Layer, Application Layer, and Technology Layer. The modeling of data objects and the technological level for AutoMI’s CRM is not required.
