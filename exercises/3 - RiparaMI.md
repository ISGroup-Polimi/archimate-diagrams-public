RiparaMiCar (RMC) is a company specializing in vehicle repair and assistance that intends to offer its customers a new way to book appointments online.

The application that will enable this service is a custom-developed application that will offer the following features: booking a new appointment, modifying an existing appointment, and paying for the scheduled service. The first two functionalities will rely on RMC’s company ERP, which can be integrated with the new application through an API interface. The payment functionality, however, will refer to an external system—provided via the cloud in SaaS mode—that will allow the user to complete the transaction. The RMC booking system will be based on a two-tiered application configuration.

With reference to the previous text, define the Archimate diagram consisting of the Application Layer and Technology Layer. The modeling of the ERP at the Technological level is not required.
